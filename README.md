I made my own character controller using 3D math and basic
physics. I improved important concepts about OOP like polymorphism, using abstract classes and
interfaces, and applying Generics to the classes. I learned and applied optimization techniques such
as occlusion culling and texture optimization, and I learned about textures and materials applied to 3D
models. I studied and used cameras from the Cinemachine package and applied a leaderboard using
the LootLocker package.
