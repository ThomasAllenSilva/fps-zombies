This project was created for the purpose of becoming more familiar with Unity in a 3D environment and improving C# OOP skills with Math skills.Â 

# Character Controller

I made my own character controller using 3D math and basic physics. With this CC, the player can climb stairs and slopes, and it's fully editable. It's built with Unity Rigidbody, so it can interact with physics too, but the rigidbody only handles collisions; the rest of the physics is controlled by script.

I improved important concepts about OOP like polymorphism, using abstract classes and
interfaces, and applying Generics to the classes. I learned and applied optimization techniques such
as occlusion culling and texture optimization, and I learned about textures and materials applied to 3D
models. I studied and used cameras from the Cinemachine package and applied a leaderboard using
the LootLocker package.
